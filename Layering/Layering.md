**#Layering**
Layering is a layering of systems so each has to be beaten in order to fully compromise a system. This can be implemented in a variety of ways and applied in booth a physical sense as well as virtual. 

**#Good Example: Justification**
This example of shows the layering principle. Since one must first login in as a user then login as an admin, multiple mechanisms must be defeated for someone to fully compromise a system. 

**#Bad Example: Justification** 
This example isn't a good display of the layering. One only has to beat the intial login system in order to fully compromise the system.
