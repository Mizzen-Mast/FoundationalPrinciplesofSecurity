Foundational Principles of Security 
====================================

-----------------------

**This is a homework assignment for COSC 4010 at the {Removed for Privacy Reasons}, plagerize at your own risk.**

 
The purpose of this assignment was emphasize good practices of security in code through examples. There are 2 examples for each concept: a good example and a bad example. We were also instructed to find or create a picture or gif that exemplifies the given principle.  

I followed the order of the principles as they were presented in class. 

1. Domain Seperation
 - Domain Seperation is setting up and maintaining boundaries between distinct units.
2. Process Isolation
 - Process Isoltation is the segregation of different processes in order to ensure the processes don't run in the same memory or share resources that aren't intended to be shared.  
3. Resource Encapsulation
 - Resource Encapsolution is the enclosing of resourses inside of a container with the express intent of restricting the use of that resource to be used only in the intended manner.  
4. Least Privilege
 - Least Privilege is giving the least amount of access required to do the job. 
5. Modularity
 - Modularity is seperating a system into seperate distinct units that can be removed, swapped or otherwise changed in an easy manner without a bunch of unnecessary overhead. 
6. Layering
 - Layering is setting up various stages that must be stepped through, the intended effect is segregating the system into seperate units so if the outer one is compromised the next layer down is till intact. 
7. Abstraction
 - Abstraction is hiding the fine details of a process behind a the general concept. 
8. Data Hiding
 - Data Hiding is denying the user access to the data. They can change the data in a means the developer allows in but thats it. They don't have direct access to it. 
9. Simplicity
 - Simplicity is keeping things as plain as possible. This means using concepts and practices well understood within a domain and leaving things from outside of that area out amongst other things. 
10. Minimization
 - Minimization is reducing the overall surface of the program, this can be from ports to extra unneeded code.
