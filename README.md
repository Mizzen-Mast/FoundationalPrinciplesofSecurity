**This is a homework assignment for COSC 4010 at the Univeristy of Wyoming, plagerize at your own risk.**

 
The purpose of this assignment was emphasize good practices of security in code through examples. There are 2 examples for each concept: a good example and a bad example. We were also instructed to find or create a picture or gif that exemplifies the given principle.  

I followed the order of the principles as they were presented in class. 

1. Domain Seperation
 - Domain Seperation is setting up and maintaining boundaries between distinct units.
2. Process Isolation
 - Process Isoltation is the segregation of different processes in order to ensure the processes don't run in the same memory or share resources that aren't intended to be shared.  
3. Resource Encapsulation
 - Resource Encapsolution is the enclosing of resourses inside of a container with the express intent of restricting the use of that resource to be used only in the intended manner.  
4. Least Privilege
5. Modularity
6. Layering
7. Abstraction
8. Data Hiding
9. Simplicity
10. Minimization
