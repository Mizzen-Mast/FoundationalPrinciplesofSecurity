**#Resource Encapsulation**
Resource Encapsulation is the enclosing of a resource within a container in order to ensure the resource is used in its intended manner. The best way to show this is through example. Lets look at a cd drive within a computer, it is encaused in a metal enclosure. This is to prevent people from using it in a manner that isn't intened. For example, if I were to just have the cd drive without that enclosure I could potentially use it to launch compact discs at people. This is prevented by the enclosure. 

**#Good Example: Justification**
This is an example of resource encapsolution. The resources in this case would be the variables, and functions. The variables, position and color are encapsulated in the Car class and access isn't given to them unless one uses the appropriate functions already provided by the class car class. The functions provided, are also encapsulated by the class. This matches the part of allowing the user to operate on the data but only on a manner which is inteneded by the developer. 

**#Bad Example: Justification**
THis is a bad example of resource encapsulation since the user had direct access to the varibles in the Car class. While the data is still encapsulated, the user can do as they please with the data and modify it in manners that aren't intended by the developer of the Car class. 

**#Picture: Justificaiton**
THis is a great example of resource encaptsulation. The driver only has access to the gas pedal and brake. The actually mechanics of the gas distribution are left to the functions within the engine. THis also keeps the driver from passing unintened commands to the engine as they can only pass a very small subset as restricted by the interface of break and gas pedal.
